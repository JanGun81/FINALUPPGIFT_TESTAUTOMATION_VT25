Part of Online Course "Test automation and AI" in Fall term 2025 on Frans Schartau Handelshögskola in Stockholm. 
The focus here is creating a CI/CD Pipeline where Playwright End-to-End and API tests can be ran on different triggers. Test types include functional tests, API tests and accessibility tests.
A lab website "https://hoff.is/login" and "https://hoff.is/store" is used as an example and can be extended upon further.
